# Sexbook GTK

### Setup

1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).
   Beware that it has multiple environments for Windows; we'll use the `UCRT64` environment.
   Check out [other environments](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/).

2. Install these packages using `pacman` (msys64\usr\bin\pacman.exe):
    - mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gtk4
    - mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-python-gobject
    - mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-python-pip (optional)
    - mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-python-sqlalchemy
